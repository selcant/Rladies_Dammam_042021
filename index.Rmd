## Welcome  

These are the materials for an invited talk for R-ladies Dammam by Dr. Selcan Aydin. 

## Prework

I assume that you have heard of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and maybe gave knitting a try. If not, no worries you will get to try it now! This will be a very hands-on session where together we will:

+ Knit an Rmarkdown file to html. Make it prettier!

+ Build a website using Rmarkdown. Share it with the world?

Please make sure you have installed the packages below:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse","DT", "palmerpenguins"))
```
