## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Changing themes

You can update the 'look' of your html document by changing the `theme` option in the `yaml`. Look here for all the free bootswatch themes that are compatible with R markdown html document <https://bootswatch.com/3/>.

## Including Tables

You can also add tables using the `DT` package. Note that you need to change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` to run this code chunk while the document is knitting.

```{r table, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
library(palmerpenguins)


# Making downloadable data tables

create_dt <- function(x){
  DT::datatable(x,
                extensions = 'Buttons',
                rownames = FALSE, filter="top",
                options = list(dom = 'Blfrtip',
                               buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel'),
                               pageLength = 5, scrollX=T))
}


create_dt(penguins)

```

## Getting fancy tabs {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Here is a neat trick to get tabs in your html document.

### Tab 1

```{r distribution, out.width= "75%", eval = FALSE}

# Histogram example: flipper length by species
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"))
```

### Tab 2

```{r scatterplot, fig.width=10, fig.width=10, eval =FALSE}
# Scatterplot example 1: penguin flipper length versus body mass
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species,
                 shape = species),
             size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"))

```


## Caching code chunks

What if a step is taking too long and I don't want to re-run it every time I knit?

```{r cache_example, cache = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

mean_penguins <- summarize_if( penguins, is.numeric, mean, na.rm=TRUE )

```


```{r display_mean, eval=FALSE}
create_dt(mean_penguins)
```
